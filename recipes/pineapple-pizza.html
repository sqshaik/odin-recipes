    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h5>For the pizza</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Homemade pizza dough (or store-bought, see note)</li><br>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce (plus more as needed)</li><br>
        <li>1 ½ to 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li><br>
        <li>½ cup diced deli ham (plus more to taste)</li><br>
        <li>½ cup fresh diced pineapple, thoroughly patted dry (plus more to taste)</li><br>
        <li>Dried oregano to taste</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h5>Melted garlic butter(for brushing)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons melted unsalted butter</li><br>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li><br>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li><br>
        <li>Salt to taste</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>If making your own pizza dough at home, make my pizza dough recipe until step 9. You only need one pizza
            dough ball for this recipe. You can also use store-bought dough, see note below.</li><br>
        <li>Make sure your oven is preheated at 475 degrees F.</li><br>
        <li>After you have brushed the dough with olive oil and pricked it with a fork (as directed in step 9 of my
            homemade pizza dough recipe), add the toppings. Start pizza sauce, then the cheese, ham, pineapple, and
            oregano. You can adjust the topping quantities, but don’t overfill it, as this can make the pizza soggy.
            Important: Thoroughly pat dry the pineapples before adding in order to prevent excess moisture.</li><br>
        <li>Make the melted butter by combining the melted butter with the garlic powder, oregano, and salt. Brush the
            borders with the melted garlic butter.</li><br>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until bubbly and the edges are golden brown. Slice and serve!</li><br>
